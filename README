=== Performance of glMatrix (JavaScript) vs GLM (C++)

This benchmark is a stripped down version of the WebGL Matrix Benchmark (http://glmatrix.googlecode.com/hg/benchmark/matrix_benchmark.html).
This benchmark only tests glMatrix to compare the results with the GLM (C++) runtime. A few test cases has been removed since they don't exists in GLM.

To run the benchmark, start the glMatrixBenchmark.html in a webbrowser to get the performance metrics for glMatrix / JavaScript
To run the GLM matrix run make

The math libraries this benchmark uses are:

GLM http://glm.g-truc.net/
OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification.

glMatrix https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix
Javascript Matrix and Vector library for High Performance WebGL apps

Besides it uses a high resolution timer class from:
